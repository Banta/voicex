VoiceX is an infrastructure designed for rural areas/slums where people do not have computers/internet access. The goal is to enable people to search for information, generate and share information, exchange knowledge, be social, and much more, all through their feature phones, over SMS. This infrastructure is available over a toll-free number in Kenya at no cost, for people to build their own network and participate in information sharing/knowledge exchange.
